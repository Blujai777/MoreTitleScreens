this mod adds some more title screens when you open the game!

You can change the custom titles document to remove my titles and add your own!

make a new line and add the title of your art and it should be seen by the mod,
put your image into the illustrations folder with the name "intro_roll_c_" with the exact same name.

So if you put "MyArt" into the text file, the name in the folder should be"intro_roll_c_MyArt" and it has a chance to be played when opening the game!

thank you so much to OlayColay for being my mentor for modding this incredible game
